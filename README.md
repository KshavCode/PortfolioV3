# PortfolioV3

The version 3 of the portfolio is ready after a long time. I was delaying it because I didn't feel doing web developing without introducing new to my webpage. In my Version 1, there was nothing new, just filled random colors and did a lot of hardwork for a single webpage (and the webpage was pretty long because I added images and paragraphs) but it was my first portfolio project so I don't think it will matter.
Then came Version 2 which was brilliant as I add an animation of typing, then added hover cards which were linked to my projects and animations in the bottom social handles button when you hovered over them. Plus, the major change was that this time, I used proper color combinations. Even though the template was a little bit similiar like the previous 1 but I added brilliant features to it. 
Now let's talk about this version.

## What's New?
1. The template has changed.
2. A lot more projects have been added, and to keep it simple, I used images and their names when hovered.
3. The color combinations became 4 times better! Now you can select themes as per your preference! Though it won't save your preference because I need to learn about cookies and cache. But you can still have fun with all 4 new themes! Thanks to Javascript.
4. The website has been optimized and there's hardly a chance if some device won't be able to run it properly!

That's all for now. I created all my portfolio versions for my own learning, not for showcasing my skills. It would help me to use all the concepts in my projects. All the projects have been completed except the Headphone webpage (will be completed soon). Also, I have added source code for every project except for discord bot. Although, you can invite it in your discord server and have a look at it's functionalitites. The discord bot project is my first ever project which was created on July 2021, so that's why I can't leak the source code as there is an authentication key within it. 
Thanks for visiting the profile and you can have a look on more things!
